# Py Discord Countup
A countup system, on discord.

Make a channel where people can countup...

This is a "anticheat" where it deletes wrong and uncorrect messages, and saves the current number in a file.

Beaware when the bot is offline, it does not moderate messages, it will not update the counter.

To make sure that the bot is online, it replies with a update messages, every time the counter is updated.

The bot sends a update message, every startup and tells the users the countup status, so if the bot was offline, unprotected and users typed high numbers, those don't count and the users will get the latest updated counter.
