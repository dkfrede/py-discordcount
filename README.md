# Py Discord Countdown
A countdown system, on discord.

Make a channel where people can countup...

This is a "anticheat" where it deletes wrong and uncorrect messages, and saves the current number in a file.

Beaware when the bot is offline, it does not moderate messages, it will not update the counter.

To make sure that the bot is online, it replies with a update messages, every time the counter is updated.
